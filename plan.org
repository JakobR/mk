* Plan
** TODO Allow project-local templates by searching the current directory and parent directories
   - Recognize local template files by prefix =.template-=, i.e., local template files have names of the form ~.template-<PATTERN>~.
   - Check vim-template docs how they do it, ideally we should be compatible (but only if their way isn't less powerful; compatibility isn't crucial)
   - be sure to use the real path of the current directory (if we entered it via symlink)
** TODO Integrate into emacs
** Later: maybe also allow templating of full project structure (like ~stack new~)
*** This might require a separate command-line argument "template", since I can't just match the file extension
