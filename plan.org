Goal:
      Be able to execute a command like ~mk path/to/file.hs~

Function:
      1. ~mkdir -p "path/to/"~
      2. ~vim -ec "wq" -- "path/to/file.hs"~


* Plan
** Re-use the format from vim-template
** Include my custom variables (now implemented in vimscript) directly into this program
** Look at how vim-template is implemented w.r.t. vim-hooks, and integrate this program into vim instead
** Integrate into emacs
** Later: maybe also allow templating of full project structure (like ~stack new~)
*** This might require a separate command-line argument "template", since I can't just match the file extension
** Also make shell aliases like ~mkm~ and ~mke~ which create the file and open it with ~m~ or ~e~ afterwards
   #+BEGIN_SRC zsh
   function mkm {
       mk "$1" && m "$1"
   }
   function mkec {
       mk "$1" && ec "$1"
   }
   #+END_SRC
** Post it on the vim-template github page when done? maybe someone else there is interested in a standalone implementation.
